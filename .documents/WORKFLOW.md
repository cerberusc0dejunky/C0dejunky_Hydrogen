# Development Workflow

## 📚 Documentation-First Approach

Before implementing any feature, **ALWAYS**:

1. **Check** `C:\Users\Quant\Projects\Hydrogen\Documentation\` for relevant Shopify docs
2. **Read** any new documentation files added
3. **Understand** the official Shopify patterns and best practices
4. **Implement** following the official guidance
5. **Test** according to Shopify standards

## 📂 Documentation Folder

Contains official Shopify documentation for reference:
- Customer Account API setup
- Product components
- Infinite scroll patterns
- Web components
- Self-hosting guides
- And more as added...

## 🎯 Workflow Rules

### When User Requests a Feature:
1. ✅ **First:** Check Documentation folder for related docs
2. ✅ **Second:** Read and understand Shopify's official approach
3. ✅ **Third:** Implement using official patterns
4. ✅ **Fourth:** Test and verify

### When User Adds New Docs:
1. ✅ Review the documentation
2. ✅ Update implementation to match
3. ✅ Follow official Shopify patterns
4. ✅ Keep code aligned with best practices

## 📝 Current Documentation Files

The user adds Shopify documentation directly from their admin/docs.
Always reference these for the most up-to-date patterns.
